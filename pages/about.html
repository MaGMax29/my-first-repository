                    Let's start by saying thank you for being here and for taking the time to read about me and my journey to this point in my life! I really appreciate it. Since I was a little girl, I have been fascinated by arts and crafts and the beauty of making things with your hands. One of my early memories is spending time in our local Art Summer Camp creating different pieces and experimenting with all sorts of materials. It was there, at 8 years of age, I discovered my aptitude towards the arts and my undeniable love for them.
                    Later on I remember being in love with portrait drawing and replicating the faces of models and people I saw on magazines. I found myself very comfortable with this practice but then life happens and we generally forget what really matters to us and what makes us happy.

                    I went to college to become an Accountant and sadly my passion for the arts faded into the background uintil one day I made the decision to follow my dreams to travel the world. I ended up settling down in my lovely Ireland. 
                    After so many years of being lost in books, responsibilities, and commitments I found myself in this charming place full of posibilities. It was the best decision of my life and I am so greatful I had the courage to take the step that led me in this direction.
                    As a textile artist I love to try all kinds of materials, tools, textiles, and techniques. I believe that art is an expression of oneself and we are more than just one thing, so why limit ourselves? Exploring and being curious is what takes us further in life, so by incorporating this philosophy into my creations, I believe I can achieve self improvement while having lots of fun!
